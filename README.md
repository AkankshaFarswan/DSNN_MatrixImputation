# DSNN_MatrixImputation
DSNN algorithm stands for Doubly Sparse in DCT domain with Nuclear Norm minimization. It is developed for imputing missing values in microarray gene expression data functions-
1) data_preprocessing.m - for log-transforming data if the data has high range of values.
2) data_reverseprocess.m - converting back log-transformed data to original values
3) DSNN- main algorithm for imputing missing values in gene expression 


%% NOTE: please install spgl solver and keep it in your path in matlab for this algorithm to work
